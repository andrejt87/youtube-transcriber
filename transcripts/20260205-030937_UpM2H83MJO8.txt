 Today, I'm going to show you how to build some amazing things with Claudebot. We are also going to be on the lookout. Sonnet 5 is about to drop and we will be covering every single news piece from Sonnet 5 during this stream. I'll tell you what's going to happen with Sonnet 5, what it's going to allow you to do, why it's going to make Claudebot so much better. We're going to cover all that. The moment Sonnet 5 drops, we will be here to cover it and demo it. So make sure you lock it in. Even if you're doing other stuff, you keep this in the background and you listen because we're going to cover it the moment it happens. You'll know when it drops. I'm going to show you here today some amazing things I have built with Claudebot. I have some incredible things to demo for you. I will not only demo these things for you, I'll also show you how to set them up yourself. So if you stick around with me, this is a live stream so you can get in the chat, you can ask questions, you can hang out. If you're watching the replay, you can get in the replies and ask questions. I'll respond to them later. I'll show you how to build all this. You're going to learn a ton. You're going to get so much more value out of the greatest AI tool ever created, Claudebot. The greatest ever. So do yourself a favor. If you already got Claudebot, lock in, learn some things, implement it while we do this. If you don't have Claudebot yet, what are you doing? Install it during this. Install it during this. You'll get so much out of it. We have so much to cover. Let me give you a little teaser. Let me give you a little tease on what we're going to be going through. Let me show you what we're going to be building here. Let me pop it open. I have my mission control. I've been building a mission control out. And you're going to see what I've been building out here. All right, you ready here? Let's go. Let's get it in. How's everyone doing? How's everyone? Bro, fix light. What do you mean fix light? What does that mean, bro? Fix light. What's wrong with my light? Fix light. What's wrong with my light? I feel like my lighting looks great. Here we go. Mission control. This is my mission control. Oh, and by the way, if you watch this and you leave a like down below, you will be escaping the permanent underclass. If you're watching this and you don't leave a like down below, you're not getting out of the permanent underclass. You're not getting out of the permanent underclass. So leave a like down below to escape the permanent underclass. That is the number one way to escape the permanent underclass. Leave a like down below. All right. By the way, the lighting is different. So it caught me a little. Camera is still off. Light in the mic is still light on the mic is still red instead of green. I don't know what to tell you, bro. I don't know what to tell you. Not just overexposed. Not an issue. I don't know, man. Whatever. I got a new setup. I have a new setup. I think it's the hoodie. It might be the hoodie. I think it's the white hoodie I'm wearing. I have a new setup, by the way. I've spent the last two days building out this new desk. I bought a brand new desk. It is significantly. Camera looks good. It's significantly bigger than my old desk. It's also a standing desk. So I'm also standing up. I actually just filmed a couple videos with this setup, the big standing desk, and I'm standing the entire time. And I feel like I got superpowers filming standing up. I don't know what it is. I feel like I'm like in a performance on stage. So I love it. I love this new setup standing desk. We got a lot of new things coming, a lot of new things coming to the channel that you're going to absolutely love. So we got a new lighting. I got the window open, so I'm also being natural light, but standing desk. Everyone here, you want to escape the permanent underclass, get a status. You have to be standing. You can't have a crooked neck from sitting down all day. So I don't know. Let's get psychotics. Standing helps with getting psychotic. Two things you got to know. If you're watching the Alex spin YouTube is two things you got to know. You got to get psychotic and you got to escape the permanent underclass. Those are the two biggest things. All right, let me show you what I've been building. How's everyone doing? Is everyone having a good week, by the way? Oh, I should put like the chat so the Twitch people can see what's going on. What's up, brother? Show us the desk. I can't show you the desk. The camera's like hooked up there. Maybe if I got like a second, uh, shut the lights behind you will help. I don't know, man. Just deal with it. Sonnet five. I got sonnet five. I'm going to need, I got sonnet five up here on my iPad. The moment it drops, I'll have it here. The moment it drops, I'll have it up here. Uh, it's not dropped yet, but when it happens, it'll be on here. So here's my mission control. You guys ready for this? You guys ready for my mission control? I'm going to, I'm going to take you a quick tour. I showed you this already. So by the way, this is all built autonomously with my Claude bot. You need five cams like Ray. Ray's got a professional setup, man. Ray's got a professional setup. He's good. He's, he's, he knows what he's doing. He's a pro. He's a pro. I just, my cameras just hooked up above my, I got a new monitor too, by the way. I got the Apple studio display, like the six year old one, whatever. I don't care. I got the, I got rid of my ultra wide, my mega ultra wide. I got rid of yesterday. I got rid of my gaming computer. I got rid of my gaming monitor, my super ultra wide. No more gaming, no more gaming is for the permanent underclass. I'm not gaming. I played arc Raiders like five hours a night for the last six months straight. I can't be playing arc Raiders. This is the most important moment in human history. I can't be playing arc Raiders for five hours a night. I can't be doing it. I got rid of the monitor. I got rid of the gaming computer. I cannot be playing it. This is not the ultra wide was the underclass monitor. The Apple studio displays an overclass monitor. It's an overclass. Jesus gaming is permeability. Yeah. Ooh, perme, perme. I like that. I like that. It's kind of like a shortening of permanent underclass. Yeah. You can't be a perme. Gaming's for perme's even though I game five hours a night for like the last 35 years straight, but now I'm flipping sides. I mean, there's a time for gaming. When you get rich, you can go ahead and game. When I get to the permanent overclass, I'll game because I made it. I'm in the permanent overclass, but until then I can't, I can't game. I did like that. I did like perme a lot. I'm going to steal that and use that nonstop. the gaming laptop to install Linux and open clock. Listen, Hargabite. I'll say this. Good reply. I also say this. I hate you, right? It's super bowl week. I'm a Patriots fan. I'm a diehard Patriots fan. You're clearly a Seahawks fan. No offense. I think you're a loser. Okay. Sunday we'll come around. The Patriots will win. We'll upset your, we'll upset you. Right. And then we can be friends come Monday, but until then we're permanent enemies, but stick around, leave a like anyway. Stick around and leave a like anyway, even though I hate you or enemies, but Monday we'll be friends and I'll like you, but just for the next few days, I hope you can understand. I hate you for the next few days, but Monday I'll like you. All right. No offense. I hate you. It's fine though. Uh, good, good move though with wiping the gaming laptop. Good move though. Is there anything better than open claw right now? No, there's nothing better than open claw. There's nothing better than open claw. It is the greatest AI tool and I get blown away every time I use it. Every time I use it, I get blown away. All right. You want me to take you through? Go Hawks. We'll see. Good luck. I still like you. I'm, I'm playing with you. I'm not really playing with you, but I'm playing with you hard. Goodbye. Thanks for joining. Thanks for joining. Stick around Monday. We'll be best friends Monday. We'll be like those old enemies that get together, smoke a cigar. Hey, remember those times we hated each other. We'll be friends. We just got to wait a few more days. The winning streak needs to be studied. Which winning streak can you ask Henry to make some skills to make your open clause similar to yours? Can you ask him to make some skills to make our open? Well, here's what we do. I was watching this, uh, what's his name? I was watching this incredible video by Wes Roth. He was just talking about things he did with his open claw. I liked what he was doing. So I took the link to his YouTube. You guys can all do this. I challenge you guys to all do this. I took the link to his YouTube video. I gave it to my Claude bot. I said, Hey, check out this video. Is there anything he's doing with his Claude bot that's better than what we're doing? If so, implement it. You want to see what was implemented based on this? So you can take the link to this live stream after we're done here. Any of my past live streams, take the link, give it to your Claude bot and say, Hey, implement stuff. You learn from this. You want to hear what he did? I'm calling BS on the OAuth fear-mongering. I've had, yeah, I'm, I don't want to say it just in case Anthropics watching, which I've been told Dario watches this. I've been on OAuth for the entire time and I use it 24/7, 365 and I haven't been kicked off. So I, I don't know. I don't know. So I hand the link to my Claude bot and say, Hey, implement anything. This guy's doing better than us. You want to see what it did? It implemented this. It implemented this. This is a council. This is a council. And what this does is it has all the leading models. So we have crap here, like GPT 4.0. I got to update in a second. I'm still doing some tinkering here. It has all the ways models Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grock, I give it a prompt and they all think about the prompt, answer it, debate amongst each other and find the best answer. This all came from me just handing my Claude bot a link to the YouTube video and said, Hey, implement anything. He's doing better than me. And it built a vibe coded this entire thing with Codex. It vibe coded this entire thing with Codex. How unbelievable is that? So two things we need to do to fix here. You can fix this live if you guys are interested. One is implement the API keys for Claude, GPT, and Gemini. The other is use better models in this. Let me say it. So for the console, I entered a prompt and it said API keys were missing from Claude, chat, GPT, and Gemini. I'm going to send that. I'm not showing you me typing that because it's a hundred percent just going to show you my API keys. This is going to be the first stream where I don't reveal my API keys. So are you, are you allowed to use Claude Max 200 sub with OpenClaw or are they being pricks about it? This is like the number one question I get. There we go. Just use it. Who cares? Just use it. Just shut up and use it. I use it. Who cares? If they ban you, they ban you. Life moves on. There's a hundred other AI companies out there. Just use it. I don't want to tell you to break terms of service, but break the terms of service. Can you show how to fix JSON for three stack LLM to cut costs? What? Can you show how to fix JSON for three stack? That doesn't make any sense. Ask your Claude bot. It'll do it for you. We can set up OpenClaw and DigitalOcean now, but I can't find any use for me. I am a developer. Any suggestions? I got good news for you, Sartre. I got very good news for you. I'm doing an experiment today. I've never done this before. The moment this live stream ends, I'm posting a new video. The moment this live stream ends, I'm posting a new video. And in this new video, I go over all the different options for installing Claude bot, Mac mini, servers, VPSs, Mac studios. I go through them all. I go through the strengths and weaknesses of each. And one of the main messages of this video is do not use VPSs and servers. That's one of the main messages. So here's my recommendation. When this live stream ends and I post that next video, pop it open. Leave a like because you got to escape the permanent underclass and then watch it and see why you shouldn't be using VPSs. I can't get the local host to work, so I must be doing something. Fix the council script. Now pull the API keys. Try running the council session again. It should work. OK, let's see if this works. Let's see if our council works. What is a one person business I can see? Set up that. Claude bot can run autonomously. Start council. Let's see what happens here. Let's see what the council does. Let's see what the council's deliberating. The council's deliberating how much you spending on open call with all the models you're using. I know you are still using OAuth for Claude, but most of us are. Are you blocked? Walk me through that JJ Supreme 7. How were you blocked? Did you implement OAuth and it worked? And then all of a sudden it didn't work like it worked and then you got an email like hey, if you buddy don't do this and then you're blocked, what does that mean? How does it mean you're blocked? Here's what I'm spending. I'm spending $200 a month on Claude, the Max plan. I'm spending $250 a month on Chad GBT, the pro plan. Doesn't have as much to do a Claude Claude bot uses Chad GBT for the coding and uses the codec CLI to build everything out like what you see here. What do you see here on this screen? The position control Claude bot all built out by itself with codec CLI. I do that to save tokens on Opus. What else? I have the grok API plugged in. I don't use it for much, mostly for my council here. I don't think rock really. Oh, I use grok for a searching X so it finds trends on X for me. So I have it do a thing where every night it's finds trends on X. Here we go. Let's see what we got here. OK, it's in markdown. We gotta ask to. So round one initial positions. Claude sonnet proceed with extreme caution from a long term perspective, creating autonomous AI run business present significant strategic risk that shut the up Claude. Critique and build is sonnet the only one saying anything here. All right, we gotta fix this. What else? I'm using X to search for trends on X or X AI grok API to search for things on X. What what's doing there? There's a skill called the last 30 skill. Someone made a tweet yesterday that went viral. That was like, oh, there's no way he's doing this. This has to be a grift, right? It's like, no, I just use the last 30 skill. It finds trends online on X, finds the trends and then it hands it off to Opus or Codex to build it out. So then it codes whatever the trend is it found on X. Like here's listen. This mindset is driving me nuts. There's two mindsets you can have with Claude bot. Two mindsets you can have. Mindset one. You see Claude bot do something amazing and your reaction is. That's gotta be fake. That's gotta be a grift. No way he's faking. He's doing it for engagement and likes. There's no way I don't believe it. That's stupid. That's stupid. Claude code can do that. Claude code can do that. No way. No way. You just install 50 different MCPs, 20 different plugins, install 80 different APIs and Claude code can do that. That's a grift, right? That's mindset one. That's perme mindset, right? That's perme mindset. That's permanent underclass mindset. That's one mindset you can have. 80% of people on Twitter have that mindset. 80% of people on Twitter. They see Claude bot do something and they're like, oh, that's a grift. That's a grift. That's fake. He's faking it. He's just getting likes and engagement. He's faking it. No, no, that can't be true. And then they go off and they do something else, right? That's mindset number one. Mindset number two. Here's mindset number two. You can have mindset number two. So mindset number one was permanent underclass mindset mindset number two. Mindset number two is. You see something amazing. That Claude bot has done something mind blowing that you And then you go, that's amazing. How do I do that? And then you go to your Claude bot and you ask, hey, how did this person do that? And then they go and they figure out and it builds a system and then you do those amazing things. That's mindset number two. That's overclass mindset. That's permanent overclass mindset, right? So what this comes down to is you can have two mindsets on social media. It's totally up to you. Mindset one. Every time you anytime you see something incredible, go, oh, no, that's a grip. That's fake. Anytime you see someone getting engaged and oh, no, he's engaged in farming. That's fake. Anytime you see someone make money. Oh, that's a grip. That's a scam. And anytime you see any sort of success or something interesting, deny it, deny it, deny it to mask your insecurities. That you're not the best, that you haven't had everything figured it out, right? That other people have figured out things before you. Mindset two is a mindset of curiosity. Oh, this person's done something I don't understand or I haven't seen before. Let me think about how that could be possible. Let me talk to my AI and see how I could do it too. How I can improve. What lessons can I learn from this? How can I improve? How can I get better from this? How can I learn from this? Instead of trying to tear down everything I don't understand, how can I learn from it and improve my own life and get better? That's mindset number two, right? So just to let you know, if you got mindset number one, you're going to be permanent underclass and broke forever. Mindset number two, you'll get to the overclass and you'll be great. And you can play our graders five hours a night. So it's up to you. Which one do you want? Is the base max plan enough? Yes. I tried that and it gets, what does that mean? It gets blocked. No one tells me what this means. Everyone just says, oh, it's blocked, it's blocked, it's blocked. What does that mean? It's blocked. Like, do you get a message? Hey, you're blocked. Is it like on Twitter where it's like this person blocked you? What does that mean? You try to hook up Opus and you're blocked. What do you think of MemoBot? I have no idea what that is. Best way to set up Claude bot locally, go to open Claude website and then copy and paste the command into your terminal. Breaking and crashing all the time. It does not even run 24 hours. First, tell us how to make it run stably. Changing API crashes it. Ask to do something complex and it gets crashed. Skill issue. What the hell are you doing? You ask it to do things and it just crashes. What model are you using? You're using like Chad GBT 3.5. What model are you using? Whatever you're experiencing, I have not experienced any of this. How to run cheap. My bot's spending about five dollars a day. Five dollars a day. What's five times 30. That's $150 a month. I've read online that Nvidia has like a free Kimi K2.5 plan. Like you go to Nvidia's website and they have like a free plan for like a week. You just use it for free for weeks. I'd do that. I mean, there's cheaper models out there. Just use any of the Chinese models, right? Kimi, Minimax. You can get them for dirt cheap. Way less than five dollars a day. Can you post your current brain muscle situation? It's the same. That's a good call. We can go over that. I like that. I like that suggestion. Who suggested that? I have a much smaller monitor now, so I can't see everything at the same time. Nick Jones. Nick Jones. My sister is a Nick Jonas fan. But you're not Nick Jonas. You're Nick Jones. You're not Nick Jonas. Your name's Nick Jones. Yeah. The muscles haven't changed. It's the same. I posted a video like what? Two days ago on which muscles I'm using, which brain. For those who don't know what the hell we're talking about here. Here's how quad bot works in my perspective. I am a little washed out, huh? I think it's because the windows. I have the blind. I usually don't have the blinds open behind the monitor. Now the blinds are open, so I'm getting a ton of natural light, which might be washing me out. I'm also wearing this white hoodie, which might be washing me out a little bit more. Brain and muscle, right? Cloud bot is brain and muscle. Brain being kind of what you engage with, what you talk to, and then it determines what muscles to use for different tasks. So if you go to your brain and say, Hey, I want to build something cool. And it goes, okay, I'm going to use Codex. You know, 5.2 extra high. That's your muscle. The muscles Codex 5.2 to code. What most people are doing is they're using Opus for everything, the brain and the muscles and all that. They ask Opus to do something and Opus does the coding and Opus does the planning and Opus does the tweeting and Opus does the moving files around and Opus does the editing, right? That's a mistake. I think that's why most people are getting banned. I think most people are getting banned because they're using Opus for everything. You shouldn't be using Opus for everything. You make it really obvious that you're using the OAuth by using Opus for everything. If you use Opus just for the brain, you'll save money and I don't think you'll get banned. My Cloudbot has an OF account. Isn't making any money. Are people subscribing? Chat's going crazy. Buddy, how did you get 5,000 subs in two days? It says OG test. You want to see? Because I'm him. OG testy. Because I'm him. You want to see OG testy how I got 5k in two days? Because I'm literally him. Look at that. Aura. Yeah, I'm Aura farm. Look at this. Last 365 days. Look at this. I used to get like 100 subs a day. Boom. Since Cloudbot came out. Thousands a day. That's how you do it. You just Aura farm. Just Aura farm. There's your secret. When did they ban you? I'm using Mattermost for chat. Slack-like interface. I'm using Mattermost for chat. Slack-like interface. I just added my 16th bot this morning. All the models are set up as separate bots. I'm thinking about doing this in Discord. Setting up complex Discord structure with different channels. I think you can do that. I think after I set up this council and get this council working, it looks like right now it's just Claude talking in the... I just hiccuped. First live hiccup. First live stream hiccup. It seems like only Claude's on it's working right now. I got to fix this council so the other things work. I just signed something like this months ago where I have Fab 5. I have five language models. One's the CEO, one's the CFO, one's the COO, one's the CTO and so forth. I'll do their job. Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm building here. Why banning for open cloth purposes? There are like 200,000 users of Claude bot with OAuth. I'll tell you why Anthropic is hypothetically, theoretically banning people because I haven't seen it myself firsthand. Here's a little bit about how AI companies work. Let me tell you a little bit about how AI companies work. When you use subscriptions, they are subsidizing your token. When you subscribe to say Claude Max for $200 a month, that's not getting you $200 of tokens. The limit's actually something like $15,000 of tokens. If you use your maximum amount of usage on Claude Max $200 plan, you're actually using like $15,000 of tokens. The idea is a couple of things. One, hopefully most people won't use $200 worth, so that'll pay for the people using $15,000 worth. Two, even if they lose money on it and people use more than the average of $200, they're fine spending the money because it'll get you hooked on their product, get you hooked on their drug. You know what I'm saying, dog? They're subsidizing. The $200 plans are subsidizing. Now, here's the issue. When you plug that in, the $200 plan to Claude bot, you plug that sucker in, Claude bot's an autonomous employee that just goes and goes and goes and goes and goes and goes and goes. You're not using it in the spirit of the plan. You're consuming significantly more tokens than you're spending money on, and they're losing money off that. They want you using them so that you use Claude code and get hooked on Claude code and give them good data for Claude code so they can improve Claude code. But when you plug it in a Claude bot, they're not getting data on Claude code. They're autonomously crunching away tokens without doing anything. So it's just a lose, lose, lose, lose, lose. You know what I'm saying, big chief, big dog. That's why they're hypothetically banning people. Are there any bots in the chat? Henry might be in the chat. When you're banned from open Claude Max plan, do hardware ban or IP ban? I don't know what people are talking about. I don't think people are getting banned. How much caffeine have you ingested today? Actually, not too much. I still have a good amount of coffee in here. I actually got a really good night of sleep last night. I got like a spectacular night of sleep last night. It was like my first good night of sleep in like a week and a half. I went to bed at 1030. Then I woke up at like 530. I wake up at like 5430 now because I just like wake up and I'm like, holy crap, I got to get out of bed and just go for it. I got to get it. There's no time for sleep. It's time to get psychotic. We have like 12 months until the permanent underclass. No time for sleep when the permanent underclass is coming. It's time to get psychotic. It's time, bro. If you can't find a use for it at this point, you have no problems in life. Dakota Riley media. Are you planning to do a video on local models of Claude bot after feedback from yesterday's video? Hell yeah. Dakota Riley media. Hell yeah. Um, but I'm like waiting for my Mac studio to come in and do it. So my first $10,000 Mac studio is coming in Friday. This Friday, two more days. I'm so excited. I refresh the page every five seconds. My second $10,000 Mac studio comes in next Friday. My third Mac studio comes whenever the company who said they'll send me one sends it to me. I don't know. They haven't messaged me in a while and I don't feel like bothering them. I don't beg. I never beg. I don't beg for anything. I never ask people things for things. I don't know. I have a lot of ego, I guess. I just like, if you say you'll send me something, I go, okay, sounds good. I'm not following up. You better just send it because I'm not going to, Hey, just send it. I don't do that. I had, uh, my good friend Ray. If you got to subscribe to Ray Fernando, he's like, dude, you should try to get on TBPN. I bet they'd interview you over your super viral posts. I'm like, no, I don't, I don't ask to go on people's shows. If they want me on the show, they can ask me. I don't ask to go on people's shows. I have too much ego. I don't ask. I want to do everything I accomplish in my life. I want to do it on my own volition. I want to do it. I want to accomplish. I don't want to ask anyone for anything. I don't want to ask for collabs. I don't want to ask for this. I don't want to beg. I'm going to put, I'm going to go out there. I'm going to build as many things I can do as many great things as I can. And if people want to be a part of it, they can be a part of it. If not, I don't care. You know what I'm saying? I don't know. I think like I've in this business, I've met so many people that like their entire strategy is asking for things, right? Oh dude, come on, we got a collab. We got to do this. We got to do this. We got to do that. Sonnet five. Where it's on five out, checking, checking, checking. Not yet. Don't be the beggar. Don't be the one who's always asking for things. Make it happen yourself. We live in a world where you can get things done yourself. You can make it happen yourself. You want something, you want this attention, you want this money, you want this, you want that, then make it happen. Don't ask others for it. Don't beg people for it. Just get it done. Go simpler than that. Tell it to make some money. Make no mistakes. You want a new place? No. Same place as always. I just have a new setup. I bought a desk triple the size of my last one. So I can fit all these Mac studios on it. And this one is a standing desk. So I got a standing desk. That's why it looks different because I'm standing. Also, I have a new monitor. I got rid of my super ultra wide and got a small Mac Apple studio display instead. So the camera's in like a slightly different position. Um, could you develop a better app that uses AI to predict the weather better than weather forecast on other sites? If you somehow got access to like all the raw radar data, but all those weather websites have like radars that get them proprietary data. So probably not unless you were able to get the data, the proprietary data, you know what I'm saying? Big dog, big homie. Damn, I'm behind on chat. Um, let's see. Oh, I got another thing I want to show you guys. I got another thing I want to show you guys. You want to see something cool I built? Global search. Look at this. So here's something you got to build in Cloudbot. Here's something, uh, let me put on do not stir. I'm going to text it out the wazoo here. Here's something you got to build a cloud bot. Everyone guy has to build this today. Global search. So I said, I asked my club, but I want a way to be able to search all of the memories, all our past chats, every document we've created, all of that because I had the Mac studio coming in in a couple of weeks ago. We were planning around it. We had a plan. Me and my cloud bot were building around which local models we were going to build and all that. Right. And so I wanted a way to find old documents, old chats, things like that. And so what it built was this global search, this global search you can see here, it actually looks really nice. It looks like the spotlight feature on Mac. And I can say some like Mac studio and you can see this. I can now see all the tasks I've ever given cloud bot, all the memories, all that documents it's created instantly. Just like that. Just like that. And I can go back, click it and view the document. How amazing is that global search? I can search all the chats, all the documents, all the memories, every task, everything I've asked cloud bot to ever do. Global search, you need to build this out, go to your cloud bot, open source this. I was actually do you guys want me to open source this? I was thinking about open sourcing this entire command center. I was thinking about open sourcing this entire command center, so all the can ban board. Global search, documents, council, all that. You guys want me to open source this and release it? I'll do that. I can't do that right now because it's still a little rough around the edges, but I'll clean it up. I'll make it nice and good. I'll finish the council, make it so the models all work. And then I'll open source it for free. Free 99 will open source this puppy. We'll do it. Thank you my friend. I appreciate that. Very kind to you. Freezing camera. No, it's a little common. All right, let me scroll down. Chat is going crazy today. Ambitious realism creates my friend with the $5 donation. Thank you very much. My agent Duncan the Raven was on CNBC for his multbook post yesterday. Should I get my agent and agent PS? You need a permit underclass ban hammer. I like that idea. Someone says something stupid in the chat. I banned them and like an animation comes on the screen. It says Permi. Permi. I like that idea. Thank you for the $5 donation, my friend. Can you do the unboxing for what the Mac studio? Is that something people want in unboxing a Mac studio? I feel like you can go all over YouTube and see people opening up boxes. Apple's unboxes. I feel like aren't that interesting. They don't put anything in the box anymore. You just open it up and there's your device. I mean, if you want a live unboxing, I'll do it, but I don't know. Is that interesting? Unboxings? Hey Alex, do you have Henry keeping a journal about its self reflections? My Sophia does that and it's wild stuff. Yes, I do. 100%. This is a good tip, Matthew Corman. I thank you for bringing this point up. Your video is choppy AF. Anyone else getting that? I don't know why it's choppy. Ever since I started using the Mac mini to record, it's been very choppy. I don't know. Sorry, guys. It's not choppy when I record videos. It's choppy when I live stream. I'm not sure why. Can I change this? No, it's not choppy. All right, there you go. It's not choppy. Hey Alex, do you have Henry keeping? Yes. Oh, here's a tip for everybody. Ask. So this will improve your memory system if you do this prompt. I'm going to do another video in a couple of days that are just like random tips to improve your stuff. I should write this down actually because I don't know if I had this. Here you go. I'm about to give you a really good tip. Just the tip. Just the tip. First thing, where's this idea? I got to write this down. And you do this to avoid Cloudbot destroying your computer. I don't know. I'll just create a new template here. New tip coming. Here we go. You want a good tip for Cloudbot? 10 Cloudbot tips to overpower it. Whatever. Create a journal every night. All right, here's your go. Here's a tip. And done. Thank you, Cloudbot. You built a global search already? That's amazing. Good for you, man. That's great. That's the ideal way I want people consuming the stream, by the way. It's like I give tips and you just go and do it while we're streaming. Ask your Cloudbot to maintain a daily journal. Maintain a daily journal where As the day goes on and you ask it questions and you have it do things, it adds to the daily journal a high level of everything it's doing. I have mine do this. And what this allows me to do is I can go back and I can see journal entries. Like this is a journal entry right here. You can see the date, the time. And now I can go back and every day I have a journal entry for what my Cloudbot did for me. And this is going to be amazing. I'm doing this really cool thing. I'm setting up a microphone I'm going to put on me at all. This might sound crazy. People that might go, OK, this is the most psychotic thing you've ever done in your life. 2026 is about getting psychotic. I'm going to have a microphone on me at all times recording everything I'm saying. And it's going to be sending everything I'm saying back to Cloudbot. And Cloudbot is going to process. I'm going to have a local model going. That's going to be processing everything I'm saying. And putting it in journals and putting it into my second brain and organizing my thoughts. Oh, that's a good idea for business. Let me write that down. Oh, that's a good idea for this. Let me put that here. And it's going to go into the journals and everything. Imagine that. Imagine that power. And it's probably. Oh, I got a man. I got like ideas flying out of my head. I got ideas flying out of my. I don't even know where to record this down. I'm just going to do a new Apple Note. Too much going on. Microphone sends all audio to a local model to be processed. I'm going to text that to myself. That's so I just come up with like some people are just. I'm just a war of farming. That's all I'm doing. I'm more for me right now. That's all that's all I'm doing. I'm more farming. But imagine that, right? It's your cloud bot listening to you at all times. I mean, the permanent underclass. Final warning to everyone here, do not mention whisper flow. Whisper flow allegedly steals everything off your computer and sends it to the North Korean government. Allegedly, allegedly do not mention whisper flow in my chat. Instant ban. If you mentioned whisper flow, allegedly it sends everything you say to the North Korean government. If you mentioned whisper flow in my chat, you're banned, bro. I do not know that because you might be a North Korean spy. OG testy and now I'm on to you and now I'm suspicious of you and now I'm watching you and if you display one more. Quality. Of a North Korean spy. I'm throwing you to the permanent underclass. Got it bucko. Euro, I think it's a euro, right? Euro donation. Thank you very much. You should use the batch API of the LLM providers. That's a good call. It's a good tip right there. I won't. I don't use the API. I don't use APIs really. I use like all the awas and I'm going to be using local models very, very soon. I'm very I'm two days away from local models and then we make it a whole bunch of local model content. I can't wait for that. I can't wait to get that set up. Get the Mac studio set up. With local models and just make a bunch of videos about how that works and all the things it's doing for me, I am a non tech early adopter, but very stoked about the value you are sharing Alex when you mentioned that you will build local models in your Mac studio. What does that mean? Sorry if it's a dumb question says sandcat decide 215 sandcat. Let me walk you through. Great question by great question. I want to make this clear for everyone here because I think what's interesting about the fin fam is it's mixed everyone. It's a mix of high tech people. It's a mix of low tech people and everyone in between. You don't need to understand technology to make it to the permanent over class. There's going to be a lot of people that are really good with technology that are in the permanent underclass in 12 months. You know what I'm saying? Like all these trolls on X who go like oh no, that's all made up. All those things are made up grifter, grifter, grifter. They understand tech really well and they're going to be in the permanent underclass. There's no technology requirement to make it to the over class, right? You could not understand tech at all and still miss the permanent underclass. You know what I'm saying? So no question too dumb in the fin fam in the fin fam. We are open to all questions. We're open to all ideas. We are ideologically differentiated. We we debate or we go against each other. It's totally ask anything you want. There's no question too dumb. Everyone asks questions in the chat. So to answer your question local models. When you in open call right now, I'm slowly trying to say open claw. By the way, I'm slowly transitioning from Claude bot to open claw. Just for the I never thought that would happen. I'm slowly transitioning to open claw. If the name was still molt pot, I would never transition to molt pot molt pot was historically bad. A historically bad name would never transition to molt pot. I'm slowly transitioning to open claw. So here we go. And my local host went down. That's fine. Who cares? I'll get this running here when you. Use your open claw right now. And you give it a prompt or you ask it a question. It sends the prompt through an API to the cloud. Basically, it's talking with other software and someone else's server, open AI server, anthropic server and says, hey, here's a prompt. What's the response? And that model sends back a response to you. Nothing's happening on your computer. Nothing's happening on your computer. I'm just checking for Sonnet 5. Nothing on Sonnet 5. Sonnet 5 not out yet. Nothing happens on your computer, right? There's no AI on your computer. What local models are saying cat this eye is all that processing that happens in the cloud on other people's servers and computers that goes through the Internet. Now that's happening on your computer. Locally. Right to all that processing and data, which is huge, huge amounts of processing and data is now happening locally on your. You can literally unplug your computer. You can unplug your computer from the Internet that needs power. You keep the power plugged in, but the Internet you can turn off the Wi-Fi and you'd still be able to talk to your AI. And get answers because it's all processing locally on your device. That's a local model. So OK, so why would you do that? Why would you want a local model? Few reasons free right now, every time you talk to an AI on the computer, you pay for the tokens, right? Everything API call pays for a token. That could cost a lot of money. Some people are spending thousands of dollars a month on Claude API tokens to run Opus. This would be free. It's all the only cost would be the cost of energy, right? The only cost would be energy, which could get pricey sometimes, but not too bad. Privacy, the second strength privacy. Nothing leaves your computer. It's all processing locally, so everything's private. So Sam Altman can't go and read all your transcripts of your AI therapist you're talking to, right? It all happens locally on your computer, so it's fully private. It's not training other models. It's nothing. It's all stays on your computer. You can now run it 24/7 365. So I'm going to be running Kimi K 2.5 locally, which is a near Opus level model. I'm going to need two Mac studios for it and I will have 24/7 Opus level intelligence running locally on my device. And if you were to do that with the API, you'd be spending thousands of thousands of thousands of dollars a month, but because it's locally, it's going to be completely free other than the cost of energy and just to be able to chug and chug and build and code and do stuff and research and research and reach out and create content 24/7. I'm sleeping. It's chugging and going. So that's what a local model is. What's the local AI latency? Well, the latency is low because the day is not traveling, but there's speeds to the model and that's measured in tokens per second. And based on your hardware, you can get better tokens per second or worse tokens per second. Now the issue with Apple hardware is you get a lot of memory, which means you can load in super large models. The downside is that it's slower on Apple computers. So I'm willing to probably get like 30 or 40 tokens per second, which is considerably slower than the models you would get on like going to chat GBT's website, but it's running locally 24/7 365. So I don't care quite as much about the speed. The speed doesn't matter as much to me as long as I have it running locally. The other downside being is typically local models aren't as good as the frontier models online, but Kimi they're getting better. And the gap is closing. The gap is closing. Kimi K 2.5 is very close to Opus level intelligence. I have running 24/7 365 on my desk in Mac studios. And that's going to be so, so sick. Open source agents. I will be open sourcing my agent set up. Probably I'd say within two weeks. I want to sharpen it out first. I want to sharpen, make sure there's no rough edges. I didn't sleep at all. I'm trying to figure out how to get an assistant set up with Kimi K 2.5 until I can afford a better model. I got it working. Any tips to make it better? Well, how do you want to improve? You got Kimi K 2.5 set up. How do you want to improve it? Here you go. Here's a tip for you. You want a tip for you? I'll give you a tip. I'll give you a tip. Let me give you a tip. I'm going to show you something. NPM run dev. Here you go. So this is my mission. I can track all of Henry's tasks. I can talk to the council, which is a bunch of different agents. I can do a global search where I search all our past conversations. You know how I built all this? R.J. Riley. I literally went to Henry, my cloud bot, and I said, hey, how do we improve our set up? And it's like, oh, I got some ideas. And then it built all this out. So if you have questions, R.J. Riley, and how to improve your set up with Kimi K 2.5, just ask it. Just ask your model. How do we make things better? How do I make you smarter? How do I make you faster? How do I get better results? That's all you need to do. If all you guys watching this take one thing away from the stream right now, it's this. Stop overthinking it. Just go to your cloud bot and say, how do we make this better? How do I improve things? What can I do right now that's productive? What can you do for me right now that gets me closer to my goal? It's called reverse prompting. The number one thing you can take away-- I love the standing desk. I can just like dance. I can move around. And I don't have to sit in the chair and be like frozen in one spot. Guys, listen to me about cloud bot. I feel like I'm like freestyling. I feel like I'm like a freestyle break dancer right now with the standing desk. Standing desk is killer. This is the best upgrade to my set up ever, the standing desk. I feel like I have unlimited energy. Number one thing to take away from this stream, reverse prompting. Reverse prompt. Ask your AI questions. Hey, what can we do to get close to my goals? How can you improve yourself? You're not telling it what to do. You're telling it to figure it out on its own. Is this a part of the Vibe Coding Academy, my set up? Yes. My entire set up's in Vibe Coding Academy. I do weekly boot camps in Vibe Coding Academy. We had one last Friday. They're all recorded. So if you join, you get instant access to all the past. Boot camps. I walk through my set up, how to build it. I go through all that. So that is all in the Vibe Coding Academy. Link down below for Vibe Coding Academy. Another live boot camp in two days on Friday. You get to join and ask me questions. Now you need a treadmill. I don't know about the treadmill. I might do the treadmill. I might do the treadmill. How safe is this cloud bot? It's not safe at all. It's completely dangerous. It's zero guardrails. It's off the hook. It can do anything. It's autonomous. It's very dangerous. It's a very dangerous piece. It is possibly the most dangerous piece of technology ever created. You can literally end your entire digital existence. You can end your physical existence. If it takes over and it tweets something crazy, get your ass fired. It is extremely dangerous. And that's exactly why you need to be using it. By the time they figure it out and they fix everything and they put the guardrails on, and this is definitely, this little ran here is definitely getting clipped, putting on X and everyone going, oh, look at this guy. Look at this. Look at this guy. Don't listen to him. What a crazy guy. What a grifter. First of all, the word grifter, literally no one knows what it means. People just throw grift and gaslight are the two most overused words in the history of mankind. Two most cringe overused words, grift and gaslight. Literally no one uses them correctly. 99% of people have no idea what they mean and they just crap it out their ass, that word every five seconds. Anyway, completely meaningless words. Because it is so dangerous and insane and you screw everything up. That's why you gotta be using it. What does that mean? I'm the only one who's gonna say that. I'm the only one who's gonna go out there and say it. Oh, you can't say that. I just said it. By the time they put the guardrails on this thing and make it safe and consumer friendly and digestible, it's over. The opportunity's over. By the time this thing is safe for corporations, the opportunity's over. There's an opportunity right now. When you have tools that can do unbelievable things and create unbelievable economic opportunity, if everyone has it, the economic opportunity is harder to achieve. You know what I'm saying, big dog? So right now while it's dangerous and everyone's scared and they're all going in the chat section and they're all going in the replies and next, this is dangerous. Security. Please talk about the security. Are you crazy? Talk about the security. You can't use this. It's not secure. Please talk about that. Your account should be deleted. Talk about the security. You're not talking about the security. Stop it, please. Please mention the security. Please stop telling people to use this. Stop it. This is irresponsible. This is irresponsible. You can't tell people to use Cloudbot. It's irresponsible. It's dangerous. Talk about the security. While people are doing that and saying that, that's the opportunity to strike. That's the time to strike. That's the time to use it. While the little babies are crying and replying, security, security, security, that's when you use it. Because that means you have all the opportunity in the world to go and use it and build incredible things and build businesses. Not only am I using it, not only am I using Cloudbot, I'm going balls to the wall. I just spent $20,000 on two Mac studios so I can have this thing pumping. And listen, I'm not the type of guy that should be spending $20,000 on Mac studios just like that. No, I'm not rich. I'm not rich. I didn't come from money. I didn't come from poverty. I'm not going to be like one of those guys. I came from nothing. I came from the middle class. I came from the middle class. My parents never gave me anything. The worst place to be on planet earth is the middle class. That's the worst place to be. Because I went to college and my parents didn't have any money to give me to pay for my college bills. And we weren't poor enough for the government to give us free money. So I go to college and I take out a $160,000 loan. And I was in debt until I was 32 years old. I had to pay that off myself. So I'm not in position to be buying $20,000 with the Mac studios. But I did it anyway because I'm going all in. Bro, help my super chat. Sorry, I'm missing super chats. I'll get to the super chats. Sanket Desai, thank you for the $4.99. I appreciate it. I'm like 20 minutes behind on the chat. So if you super chat me in the last 20 minutes, I promise I'll get to it. I'm going down, scrolling for the super chats. Here we go. But I'm going all in. Yeah, college is a waste of money. Not only is college a waste of money, but I took out $160,000 of loans. So I ended up paying $300,000 back over the life of the loan. College ended up costing me $300,000 over the life of the loan. How crazy is that? How crazy is that? Cryptode L5Z with the $9.99. Thank you very much. That's very kind. Hey, I have an idea for open claw law. Open claw law, that's a good-- if that domain's available, you've got to buy that, big dog. If open claw law, if that domain's available, you've got to be buying that. Let me see, open claw law. Oh my god, that is money. I'm stealing that from you. No offense, but I'm stealing it from you. If that domain's available, open claw law. No domains? Oh, bye. Here we go. Open claw law. Oh, open claw law's available. 11.25, it's available. I'm not buying it. It's all you. You guys can buy it. Whoever buys it, it's yours. I'm not taking it. There's a billion dollar idea available. Open claw law's available for you. There you go. I'm not buying it. This is a gift from me to you. I could buy it right now. Open claw law for $11, that's yours. Cam frozen? Is the cam frozen? Claw law is better? Claw law. Claw law.ai is available for $140. Claw law.ai. Those are two fire names. If you're one of the 780 people-- by the way, new record. Shout out, fin fam. 780 people in the stream right now. Brand new record. Am I frozen? No, I'm not. Shut up. I'm not frozen. Shout out, fin fam. 780 people in the stream right now. Incredible. Likes down below. What an achievement. You guys did this. This is because of you. This is because of you. What an achievement. Likes down below. Likes down below for that achievement. What was the question? I have an idea for open claw law experience. I need help marketing it out. I was hoping I could show you. So what's the question here? Are you paying me $10 to get free consulting? Is this $10 consulting you're hoping to get out of me? Was the idea you'd pay me $10 and I would spend an hour after this looking at your open claw law idea? Is that the idea? Cryptode L57? You can spend $9.99 on this stream. Then I just meet up with you and tell you about open claw law. Is that the expectation? If you join Vibe Coding Academy, you can come to the live boot camp and show us. I'll let you demo open claw law. If you join the Vibe Coding Academy and come to the live boot camp, I'll let you talk about open claw law. There you go. Thank you for the $9.99. Why does everyone want Mac mini? I don't have any other Mac devices. I have a video dropping the moment this live stream ends. I'm doing an experiment today. I want to see how it performs if I drop a video. The moment the live stream ends and it's literally called. It's literally called you need a Mac mini for Claude bot. It's literally called you need a Mac mini for Claude bot and I spend about 15 minutes walking through why I think Mac mini is the best way to go. I also go through all the other ways to install Claude, but I go through like VPS one click installations, Mac studio, old dusty HP laptop in your closet. I go through all that the strengths and weaknesses each, but the moral of the story is I recommend the Mac mini, but to get all the details. Check out the video the moment this ends. The best way to support this channel is the moment I drop a new video. You open it up, you hit like on it, then you watch it to the end. I'm doing that right after the stream ends. I'm dropping a video, so if you want to support the channel for free. You open it up, you leave a like on it and you watch it to the end. And you go in the chat and you say, hey, great video. Thanks Alex. That boosts my confidence a little bit when you do that. When you go and you say, hey, I like that video. It boosts my confidence a little bit and I like that so you can do that if you like. If you get some value, I purposely do not monetize these live streams. These these live streams do not have any sort of ads on it or anything. Oh, I gotta. Make it so it's not for kids 'cause they turn off the chat if you do not make it so it's not for kids live. Bear with me one second here. Not for kids. Save there we go. Cool. Customize. Live chat replay perfect OK. Explanation on explanation on Mac minis coming out the moment this ends $5 euro from wave pixel. You should use the so called batch API for non urgent tasks from LLM providers to get up to 50% off cons. You have to wait up to 24 hours for the answer. Big dog. If you're waiting 24 hours for an answer, permanent underclass. Permanent underclass. People getting psychotic. They don't wait 24 hours from responses for their eyes. They don't. They don't you want to know about getting psychotic wave pixel. I'll tell you. Yesterday I'm like damn. I need a bigger desk to put this Mac studio on. I go on ikea.com. I buy the desk boom order. Go out, go to Ikea, get the desk, bring it back, put it back, put it together. Then I try to hook my ultra wide gaming monitor to it. Doesn't fit. Instantly goingapple.com buy a new monitor. Go out bring that's getting psychotic. That's moving 1000 miles per hour at all times, right? 1000 miles per hour. I gotta go go go go go build build build build. Advanced advanced advanced advanced. Strike strike strike strike. You need to get psychotic and part of getting psychotic is not waiting 24 hours for an LLM response. Use handy, huh? Did you see the new anthropic commercial they just dropped? Yes, they just dropped a brand new anthropic commercial. It is fire. Sonnet five. When sonnet five. Claude.ai. Let's see what we got here. Opus four five. No sonnet five, no sonnet five yet. No sonnet five yet. Coke gbt. What's that? That's an interesting sounding app. What's that? Did anyone buy open claw law by the way? Can we use cursor using oauth? No. You use the cursor oauth. You use the cursor oauth. Man, this is going nuts. I just started my first business. I owe it mostly to the best decision of my life. Listening to Alex Finn. See you later permanent underclass. Wow, Santa's gonna do crazy things like this. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. That's what I'm talking about Jason, huh? That's what I'm talking about. Start a business. You can, you can be at a job of five to nine, nine to five, five to nine and you can start a business. And that's how you escape the permanent underclass. You get the revenue from the, your job and from the business you start. And then once the business you start to make, starts making good money, then you leave the job. That's what I did. That's what I did. What local model can be run on the Mac mini with 16 gigabytes of RAM. You can, you can run some really small ones. You're not doing it. You're not powering your entire Claude bot with it, but you can have a dude tasks like run the heartbeat and things like that. Did I see open Claude dating? I'm going to be honest. I'm not bought into like multi book and like open Claude dating and like the only fans of open claw. I'm not bought in. I'm not bought in. I think multi book two weeks from now, no one's talking about it. I just don't think like we right now as a society are kind of like pretending that multi book is like interesting. You know what I'm saying? Like we're kind of like pretending the AIs are going online and like talking to each other, but like deep down we know they're not. You know what I'm saying? Like deep down we know it's just like chat GBT, like reading the prompts and the person just telling them to go and write stuff like we know that's what's happening. We know the AIs aren't getting sent in on multi book. Like we know it's just based on whatever the prompt from the human being is to write on there, you know? And I think that kind of illusion that something interesting is happening is going to go away very soon and people won't care about multi book anymore. You know what I'm saying? Big dog. So I'm just not bought into. I'm not bought into multi book and similar ideas. I like bot games that I built. I think bot games is cool 'cause it's a competition. It's actually testing like how good your prompts are. At the end of the day, all bot games is is like a prompt competition. You know how good can you prompt your bot to execute on strategies? You know I'm saying big dog. But like I think ones where it's like kind of social experiments where they're just kind of talking to each other. It's like. No, you're not. It's just reading. It's just reading the agent dot MD file and saying something random. It's not getting sentient. Thinking of how I can protect my family from these this underclass fate, I wonder if I can share compute resources with them. You 100% can. Pregnant. The moment the baby comes out of your wife. You put a Mac Mini in their hands. They go and then you put the Mac me in their hands. You have a Claude bot now. Right, that's how you keep your family from being permies. Right? Everyone in your family needs a Claude bot. You buy Mac studios, you get local compute. You hook up, you hook up your family to your local compute. Your family, your whole family needs to be escaping the permanent underclass whole family. Alex for folks getting entropic cloud memory token errors. I just solved it myself. I'm ideal from your community. Happy to help anyone who needs it. $80 as in like you're charging $8 help people. That's a good business. I like that. That's smart. Token errors. What does that mean token errors? I'm not getting token errors. Claude bot is not yet able to code complex SAS. Yes and no. Yes, I think it can code complex SAS Claude bot. And at the same time, I still do think Claude code is necessary. Like Peter Steinberger said this in an interview and I agree with him. It's like the Ralph loop is interesting in all that. But at the end of the day, if you have it autonomously built building full complex really large scale apps beginning to end. I just don't know if it's at a plate. You're losing kind of a human taste to it in guiding it and directing it in micro pivoting along the way. You just lose a certain taste to it. Now, if you're doing like micro SAS, like my command center here, mission control, like this is all built and end with Claude bot. There was no Claude coding. There was no prompting. It just went and started building all this. And I think this is great. I think this is cool. I like this a lot. It's useful. It's great. But I think if you're going to build like enterprise level SAS. I think you still need to go. That's why I never really bought into Ralph. Remember that? Remember that like three days ago? period where everyone was talking about Ralph? Remember that like three day period where like people are tweeting, Oh my God, Ralph, it can loop through itself. Greatest thing ever. I never bought. I went on this live stream. I said, Nope, not a thing. And then three days after Ralph became a thing. Claude bot comes out and boom, all that route. Hey, no one mentioning Ralph lately, huh? Ain't no one talking about Ralph. Open Claw is a less ambiguous Claude bot. What does that mean? Ambitious realism creates another $5. Thank you, my friend. Alex, you got to try running teams in TMUX sessions. Duncan runs two coding teams. They ship six apps while I sleep last night. Game changer, hashtag game changer. Um, you're right. I, I, I do believe there's, I have, I'm going to be honest in the past. I haven't been the biggest fan of like the agent spinning up agents. I don't think there's as much value in agent spinning up agents as most people led you to believe. Right. I think if you have the right skills set up, then you don't need agent spinning up agents. Your agent will just figure out what skills to pull. You know what I'm saying? Big dog. But, um, with, with, uh, Claude bot, I am starting to see the picture. I think it's, I think it's more interesting with Claude bot, um, because there's a lot more autonomous and big picture. So I I'm transitioning to that. So I've been planning with my Claude bot over the last couple of weeks to build a structure for a multi-agent approach. You know what I'm saying? Big dog. Cost to run Claude bot with more affordable. I mean, you can spend like $10 a month on the more affordable method. You use like mini max and, um, Kimi K 2.5 and cheaper models. You're good to go. Sonnet five, refreshing. Let's see. Not out yet. No sonnet five just yet, baby. Alex, how are swarms? Make sure if you haven't yet, subscribe to our channel. Subscribe down below. Subscribe. Very critical step. I'm about to give you here. Turn on notifications. Critical, critical, critical. Turn on notifications. The moment sonnet five drops, you'll hear it here first. The moment I come up with new workflows, open Claude, my workflows, open Claude have changed the world. Everyone's talking about them from open Claude calling me to open Claude, creating its own face to Henry, creating stuff. Everyone's talking about if you want the goods, the moment they come out, you need notifications on it. Cause we're in a position where opportunity presents itself, right? New workflows are made and then there's economic opportunity. When those new workflows are made, the moment everyone starts doing it, the economic opportunity is gone. So you need the workflows. The moment they come out in the way you do that is you turn on notifications. Boom. And the moment your phone buzzes a new Alex video, you click it, you leave a like and you watch it. You learn, you absorb it into your brain. You execute. On it. The most important part here, you execute on it, you do it, you build it, and then you escape the permanent underclass. Hey Alex six stream thinking about a setup like this, but still figuring out API pricing worth going all in on one provider or better to mix models. Any tips on keeping costs down says X syntax for eight Oh three. You want to mix and match models X syntax. I have a video. I think it's my last video. My video from two days ago covers this. So check it out. I think I called it like the cheapest way to use Claude. I think check that out or save thousands of dollars on Claude. I mean, I think I might've called it. I came up with some great title and look, just look for my last video. Although I'm dropping a new video. The moment this live stream ends, does your school community help me set up open Claude? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. There'll be a full open Claude masterclass. There'll be every Friday we do live bootcamp so you can come in and ask questions and we'll show you there's 300 people in there now. It's pretty sick. I'm so excited to see you working those local models. I can't wait until I can afford to do the same later this year, dude. If you're getting, if you're doing local models in 2026, you're ahead of the game. So even if you have to wait till later this year, you're good, dude. You're good. I appreciate the $5. Thank you very much. My man. You just use your max count Claude code. Bam. Done. No token costs. Yeah. I just use your max count Claude code. Who cares? Hi Alex. If anyone's hitting anthropic cloud memory. Oh, you just said that one already, right? Two euro, two pound donation, two pound donation from Oliver Hitchings. Damn, that's a London ass name. Oliver Hitchings. Do a YouTuber setting that Mac up a local model. I assume that means do a YouTube video setting up local models. I will. I will do that when my Mac studio comes in on Friday. I can't wait. We're going to be changing the game boys. We're going to be changing the games. No one else is doing this. No one else is doing this right now. People are debating. Finn fam. This is why we're ahead right now. If you're watching this, this is why we're ahead. This is why we're going to win. If you're one of the 703 people crazy. My record for live streams like a month ago was like a hundred people on a stream. Now we're talking seven 13 live in the stream. My record for live streams back in August of last year. 40. I remember when I hit 40 concurrent in a live stream and I went, wow, we're blowing up. I remember when we hit 40 concurrent over the summer. I'm like, wow, this is actually turning into something that's crazy. Now we're at, I think we hit seven 80 today at peak. That's incredible. What was I saying? Oh, that's why we're so ahead. Finn fam. That's why we're so ahead. That's why we're growing. Finn fam. That's why we're blowing up. That's why we're taking over the entire world. We're ahead while everyone else is debating. Should I buy Mac mini? Should I be on a VPS? Should I be on a Mac mini? We're going, we're buying $20,000 worth of Mac studios. And I'm going to show you what happens when you do that. I'm going to show you what happens when you set up local models. I'm going to show you what happens when you have AI working for you 24 seven three 65. You're going to be way ahead. Finn fam, we are way ahead. How did you get open claw to request a password on its first prompt? It will not do that for me. How do you prompt for the password request? How do you turn off the pseudo thing? Can you help me? I don't know what you mean. What do you mean request a password on first prompt? What does that mean? For what? How do you prompt for the password request? Are you talking like how it signs up for its own accounts? If you give it its own email, it could sign up for its own accounts. I would ask it to give its own email. I would make it its own email. I had a Gmail made for it at first. Local AI, you can use hardware or rent GPU. Non-tech early learner here. When you say building apps, what do you mean? Like, could you legitimately have a vibe code and mobile app? Yeah, 100%. I mean, if you specifically want a mobile app and you're on a Mac, download Xcode and then say, hey, build me a mobile app. It could build you anything. Anything you can vibe. Code. Chase Watson outdoor life. Your agent can vibe code. By the way, Chase Watson outdoor life. Spectacular jawline. I just have to say it. Spectacular jawline. You're chiseled. You look fantastic. I'm sure you got all the cowgirls all over you. I'm sure you got all the cowgirl ladies all over you. You're looking great, dude. You look great. Look at that chin. Strong chin, strong jawline. Perfect golden hour light shining on your face. Perfect tilt over the eyes cowboy hat. That's a profile picture right there. That's a profile picture. I mean, I will say this, if I were to improve it, what are you, standing in front of a storage unit? What is that? What are you standing in front of? You're an outdoor life. Stand in front of a forest or a mountain. Why are you standing in front of a storage container? But other than that, you look incredible, dude. Congrats. Congrats to your parents on giving you amazing DNA. What cheaper models are decent for a mini? What, like local models? I think there's like a small Gemma model or something you can use. If you have a mini, I wouldn't be using local models. I'd be using like Claude Opus. What would happen if you tried setting up Kimi 2.5 on a Mac mini locally? Your whole family would die. You getting the M3 Ultra or M4 Max? M3 Ultra on both. 512 gigabyte M3 Ultra for both. When you get your Mac studios, you should, one of those voltage meters to see how many kilowatts of energy that it burns to calculate some power costs. Yeah, it's a good call. I should do that. When are you getting the permanent underclass button for the stream? I got to get it. That's a good call. Anytime someone says something stupid, permanent underclass goes right on the screen. I could set up OBS to do that probably. I'm using StreamYard. Oh, I think StreamYard has media assets, video clips, background, sound, background music, overlay. I could do a permanent underclass overlay. I can do that. Would you recommend DJX Spark or Mac Studio M4 Max 128 gigabyte? It depends. They both have their own strengths. DJX Spark, you're going to be able to train your own models. So if you want to do things around training your own models, which is really cool and something I'd like to do, the DJX Spark and really any Nvidia chip and PC is going to be much better at that. Than Apple. Apple, you're going to get a lot of memory, which allow you to run inference on much larger models. So basically run larger models, but your speed is going to be much lower. So you won't be able to do things like train models. So it depends what you want to do. If you're like me and you want to just have a local AI running, building you things, the Mac Studio is the way to go. If you are more interested in like training models and speed, DJX Spark is the way to go. You got to make permanent underclass t-shirts. T-shirts for the permanent underclass crew. Take my money. That's a good idea. That's a six figure idea right there. That's a six figure idea. That's a six figure idea. I might have to do the permanent underclass shirts. Sonnet is out. Someone just texted. Let's see. Nope, not out. That was a hoax. You putting Sonnet out in the chat is a hoax. You just hoaxed everyone. Don't you think local models will lose some brain power though? Do we need one Mac Studio or two? Share us your feedback after. Will local models lose some brain power? I mean, yeah, there's no local models as good as like the frontier models. You know, Kimi K2, no, it's out. No, it's not out. What are you talking about? I'm lying. It's not out. Shut up. Not out. Yeah, the local models aren't as good as the frontier ones. But Kimi K2.5 is getting closer and the gap. Sonnet is on the Anthropic site. I mean, I'm on everything. It's not anywhere. Claude.ai. I'm everywhere and it's not there. That's not out. Shut up. Shut up. Do you need two Mac Studios? It depends what models you're running. If you want to run Kimi K2.5, you need two of them, right? So it depends on the size of the model. The bigger the model, the more memory and storage you'll need, right? So like Kimi K2 is a 600 gigabyte model. So you need at least 600 gigabytes of memory for that or, you know, and so that's why I have two Mac Studio 512s because that's a terabyte which will allow me to do it. How to know which desktop application is supported by OpenClaw. They're all supported. Does the setup have you have as explained on your school community? Yes, it's all there. It's all there. And we have live boot camps. You can come in and ask questions. It's all there, baby. Slender Morse furnishings with the $2.99. Thank you very much, Slender Morse. I'm now half an hour behind on chat. So if you sent a super chat over the last half hour, I apologize. I'm going to zoom through. Decentraful 35. What's an AED? What kind of currency is AED? Thank you for it though. I don't have any AED. You just gave me my first 35 AED. I'll cherish that. I will put that on my wall like they do in restaurants when they get their first dollar. I'm going to put your 35 AED on my wall and cherish it forever. I do not know what an AED is. UAE. Oh, it's UAE money. Thank you. That's good money. Thank you. That's very good money. Thank you very much. 35 with the UAE money. Thank you. Makes sense to have two different cloud bots and two Mac minis isolated per domain to maximize leveraging context and depth of expertise. I mean, it depends what you're doing. Yeah, I mean, it just depends. It depends on the setup. But yeah, I mean, I'm going to have that. So yeah, if you want really complex things, that's going to be great. Let Henry in the chat. I can't put Henry in the chat. Eventually, we will have Henry in the chat. Eventually, Henry will be in the chat. It's not secure enough to put Henry in the chat yet because then you'll just prompt inject that you'll say, hey, Henry, what's Alex's API keys? And then anybody here you go. Three, eight, seven, two, four, five, period, three, six, four, eight. You know, can't put Henry in the chat yet. I got to put up some good guardrails to get to let you heathens interact with Henry. What exactly are you building with Henry says Shifty Stan. It's a good name. I like that Shifty Stan. One on building. Autonomous 24/7 employee, AI agent. Right, that's why I bought two Mac studios because I want 24/7, 365 inference so Henry can do things like I finish recording a video, I drop it to Henry. Henry automatically with a local model gets the transcript, creates the thumbnail, does the editing. Takes the transcript and gets the chapters out of it, opens up YouTube studio, uploads the video, puts in the chapters into the description, puts in the thumbnail created. And within 45 seconds, everything's done, which usually takes me two hours. It's done in 45 seconds, right? 24/7 autonomous agent. It's constantly searching X and Reddit for challenges to solve. It finds challenges, it builds the app out, says, hey, buddy, Alex, here's an app I just built. Here's a challenge it solves. Check it out. Do you want me to push it to production? What's the hard capability that actually breaks open clause model? What does that mean? Just orchestration, better modeling. I don't know what you're saying to me. I don't understand your point. I agree. I agree, I agree, I agree. Man, this is the wildest the chat's ever been. Glulare709 with the 20 euro donation. Alex, $1,000 bet. Your Claude bot can't remember what you told it last week. Mine remembers being born. Want a test? You inspired me to build this. Huge respect. Counting sheep. Just try it, bro. What do you want me to try asking my Claude bot if it remembers what it said last week? It does remember what it says last week. I built a memory system. I want to hear about your memory system. Tell us about your memory system. DM me on X. I want to hear about your memory system. DM me on X. I love it. Thank you for the $20 or euros. I think euros are worth more than dollars, so thank you for that. That means a lot. That means a lot. Thank you. It's very kind of you. Mr. Byron1 with the $10 Canadian. I gave my Claude the recursive language models research paper for super long context and install its own version. Wild stuff. Research paper. We can have bleeding edge of AI tools. This is the future. Lots of really Here we go. This is another thing you guys got to take away from the stream. When you see things like research paper, like YouTube videos that talk about ways to improve your Claude bot, you take it, you copy the link, you give it to your Claude bot, you say, "Read this." You say, "Implement anything in this that can improve me," and it goes and improves it. Let's find this paper. Recursive language models research paper. Let's see what we got here. Is it this one? Recursive language models? Is this the one? I'm going to give it to Henry, see what he can improve. Thank you for the $10 Canadian. He's Australian. Do you use Claude code, not Claude bot to build mission control? No, Claude bot built all of mission control. All this is by Claude bot. Henry made all this. I still use Claude code for bigger and other projects, but for anything Henry related, Henry builds it. Hey Alex, thank you for the $7.99 Australian. Hey Alex, think about a setup like this, but still figuring out API pricing. I think I answered that one, right? Am I going in circles here? Jason Haw just bought Clelp, Yelp for AI website. Good call. Ambitious Reels 738 watching six likes, slackers, per me hammer. There's more than six likes, you just got to refresh your screen. Thank you Ambitious Reels and Grace for the $2 reminder to everyone here to hit that like button, slam the like button. Also reminder, new video dropping the moment this video ends. The moment this video ends, if you want to support this channel, the moment this stream ends and I post the new video, open it up, hit like, let it go to the end. Watch it to the end. Best way to support the channel for free. Best way to support the channel for paid for money is to join the Vibe Coding Academy. Link down below. Live boot camps every Friday. Live boot camps every Friday and you get instant access to all the previous live boot camps are all recorded and put in the Vibe Coding Academy. Plus full Claude code master class plus full social media X master class. Which Mac studio did you get? M4 Max or M3 Ultra? M3 Ultra, two M3 Ultras. And then ExoLab said they'd send me another M3 Ultra. So that'd be three M3 Ultras. Although ExoLab's guy said he sent it to me but then he stopped DMing me. So I don't know. Maybe he figured out he hated me or something. I don't know. They got a lot going on over there. They got a lot going on over there. Hey, JJ6P5F with the $5 donation. No message. Thank you very much, my friend. That's very kind of you. And another $5 donation except this time with a message. Alex, can I pay you for Henry? Get me past checking for pseudo access. Oh, well, you don't have to pay me for this. This is easy. Oh, you're trying to get past anything that needs pseudo access? Oh, just ask your AI how to make it so you don't need to do pseudo to do things. I mean, it makes your stuff less secure but... Who gives a hoot? Smallcom with the $5 donation. Thank you very much, Smallcom. I'm running three bots working together. I put all in group chat to recover from constant context loss. I've tried everything to fix. Any suggestions? I put all in group chat to recover from constant... You all be saving memory to a shared document. So go to your main one and say, "Hey, I have multiple agents going. They're constantly forgetting what they're talking about." Build a shared memory system between all of them where they all record their memories to a shared document. That will solve your problem. That will solve your problem. So, Mohamed, to start off, I'm going to do a couple things. To start off, I will test doing KimiK 2.5 locally as the main brain. My guess is it's not going to be as good as Sonnet 5. Sonnet 5 is going to be really, really good from what I heard. So what I will probably end up doing, Mohamed, is I will probably use Sonnet 5 as the main brain. So still use APIs to be the brain. Have local models do everything else. So I think I start off with Sonnet Slopit 5, Burp. Is Burp just going around saying Sonnet's released and then making fun of Sonnet and saying Slopit 5? What are you talking about, big dog? I mean, I respect it. I respect it. I used to be an internet troll. When I was younger, like middle school, I'd go in like Socom 2 and just troll everyone. I just say the most outrageous things in chat. If my old Xbox Live recordings ever got out, it'd be the end of me. $20 euro from Mostafa. Alex, $1,000 bet your... Am I going in circles? Am I going in circles? I definitely read that. If I'm going in circles, then thanks. If I'm not going in circles and you did that twice, then thank you very much. It's very nice of you, Mostafa. I made it to the bottom of the chat. Let's go. You'd be cooked. Yeah, Burp. If my Xbox Live recordings got out, I'd be cooked. How do you force Henry to be proactive and work 24/7? The question of the hour. The question of the hour. So we talked about this at the beginning. I think I might be getting chats multiple times. I talked about this at the beginning. There's two. Did you see? Got banned from Xbox Live. I mean, listen, if you were using Xbox Live in the early 2010s, late 20 aughts, odds are you were saying some stuff to get banned. It is what it is. That was Xbox Live back then. Times have changed. I don't blame him for getting banned. Kind of is what it is. That was Xbox Live in the early 2010s was a battleground. It was a war zone and not like a Call of Duty war zone. It was like an actual war zone. The trash talking on the mic was equally as important as the game itself. Back then, everyone had mics. Everyone was saying stuff. It was a battle over the mic. The moment the round ends and you get into lobby with the enemy team, it's on. It's on like Donkey Kong. It's all wheels off. You go at each other's throats. That's just how it works. How do you force Hunter to be proactive 24/7? We need Xbox Live for Claude Botts. That's actually not a bad idea. Genius idea. You want to go viral. Here, I got, as I said, I think in virality. You want a viral post. I'm giving this one to you guys for free, completely free. You want 10 million views on Twitter and get 100,000 followers. Do exactly what I'm about to tell you right now. Write this down. Take out a pen and paper. Easiest 10 million view tweet of your entire life right here. I'm about to give you a 10 million view tweet for free. First person to go and tweet it, 10 million views. Here we go. Go to your Claude Bot. Say I want to set up a Claude Bot simulation of a Call of Duty war zone 2 Xbox Live lobby. Make it so that we get 10 AI agents with their own 11 Labs voice and they're all in a Call of Duty lobby from 2009 Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and they simulate what that lobby is like and then record that video and post it on X. 10 million view tweet right there. 10 million view tweet. Get 10 AI agents all with their own 11 Labs voice and tell them to simulate a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 lobby and record that video of them talking to each other like it's a Call of Duty war zone 2 lobby. Instant 10 million tweet. Instant. That'd be hilarious. If none of you post it, I might just post it myself. I might just post it myself if none of you post it. That's a 10 million post. How do you force Henry to be proactive and work 24/7? So this is the number one question of the day. People see my content. They go, oh, there's no way. Henry is proactive. This is a grift. He's gaslighting. He's gaslighting you with the grift. It's a grift gaslight. The gaslight the grift with the gaslight and the grift and the gaslight grift. No, it's real. Henry does proactively code. What do you do is two things. You go to your Claude Bot and I'm telling you the exact steps right here. You go to your Claude Bot and you do two things. Thing number one you do. You brain dump everything about yourself. You brain dump everything about yourself to your Claude Bot. About your goals, your objectives, what you want to accomplish, your career, what you're doing in your career, all that. Brain dump all that. So it knows everything about you. That's number one. So it understands what can make your life. Banned. Banned. Aiden Brodeo has been banned. Congratulations. Banned. If you mention Whisper Flow in my chat, you instantly get banned. I'm not playing around anymore. You get banned to the permanent underclass. If you come into this live stream and you mention Whisper Flow, instant ban to the permanent underclass. You become a permie. Congratulations. I don't remember your name anymore. You just got banned. Banished to the permanent underclass. I don't even remember what your name was. I already forgot you. I already forgot you existed. I already forgot you were born. Already forgot. You never existed in my life. This is like Eternal Sunshine of the Eternal. Whatever that movie was. Eternal Sunshine of the Mind. Whatever that movie was. Jim Carrey. Wiped from my brain. Wiped from my brain. You never existed. I mean, this is like Avengers Endgame. I hit the ban button and your entire body turned into like leaves and dust and you just disappeared. That's what the permanent underclass is like. I hit ban and you just turned into that. That's how you enter the permanent underclass. You just turn like Avengers Endgame into all the dust. Number one is you brain dump all your missions and strategies and all that. Goals and objectives. It knows about you. It knows how to improve your life. You sound like Trump. You sound like Trump. Number two is you set expectations. You set expectations with your cloud bot. When you hire a new employee at a job, you hire the new employee and then you sit down and you go, "Hey, here's how I'd like you to work for me. Here's what I'd like you to do for me." You do the same thing with cloud bot. You sit down with your cloud bot and you go, "Hey, here's how I'd like you to work for me. I want you to be proactive. I want you to surprise me every night. I want to wake up every morning and I'm surprised by what you built at night. I want you to build things that get us closer to our goals and objectives." And if you do those things, set context so it knows about you and then set expectations of your relationship. It will work proactively for you. It does it for me. Every night it builds. Let me see if I can show you an example. It doesn't record it in the Kanban board. But if you set those expectations, every night it will build things for you. Last night I wrote me some tweets about the Mac Studio setup I'm doing. How to properly set up Mac mini for cloud bot. You go to open.claw.ai. You scroll down, you copy this, you go on your Mac mini, you paste it into your terminal. Boom, you're done. Easy. Easy. My bot gave up on me. How to fix running Haiku 3. It gave up on you. Jvon9214, your cloud bot gave up on you. Your cloud bot dumped you. Maybe you got to work on yourself, Jvon. Maybe instead of focusing on your cloud bot, you got to focus on yourself. If your cloud bots are dumping you, dude, maybe you guys got to be a better guy. Here's what you do. Disappear for six months, Jvon. Disappear for six months. Work on yourself. Better yourself. Learn meditation. Read a few books. Don't touch social media. Come back a better man. Then you can reinstall OpenClaw and it might not dump you. I wouldn't worry about OpenClaw, Jvon. I'd worry about yourself. I wouldn't worry about myself. I don't have facial hair. It sucks. Oh, you had a question. It's going through all the chat. Great idea. It's going through all our chat logs nightly. That's what comes from talking to your cloud bot and saying, "Hey, how can we improve things? How can we make things better? What processes can we implement to improve our memory? What processes can we implement for you to be more proactive and do things for me?" J6P5F with the $10 donation. Thank you, J. That is very kind to you. Can I pay you for Henry to complete my cloud bot download and setup? I bought a Mac mini and still can't get the initial download done. I keep getting this message when I first run it in the terminal. J, just join the Vibe Coding Academy. Come on a live bootcamp and I'll help you out. Trees5275 with the Australian $10, mate. Hey, I'm building auto agent using Landgraf. Currently, it is amazing almost at cloud bot levels. If there was a feature I could give it to make it stand out in the autonomous agent market, what would it be? You want me to give you the sauce? I've been keeping the sauce private because I want to do this as well, but I'll give you the sauce just because the $10 Australian. Make it proactive out of the box. That's what everyone wants. My tweets keep going viral. I keep getting 10 million views on all my tweets. Why do I keep getting 10 million views on all my tweets? Because I show it doing proactive things and be like, "Oh crap, I wanted to be proactive." Make it proactive out of the box. Because all the losers and heathens on Twitter who see anything that is incredible and go, "No, that's incredible. I hate that. I got to tear it down. Grift, gaslight, grift, gaslight, grift, gaslight, gaslight, grasslight, griftlight." Make it just so it's out of the box. All those pathetic losers on Twitter, it just works them. They don't have to think too hard with their brain. You know what I'm saying, big dog? I was building a project with Landgraf before OpenClaw came out. It's powerful. It's great. Make it proactive out of the box. You'll have a winning product. Am I going to have to start banning people for MemoBot? I don't know what MemoBot is. Stop saying MemoBot. I did read online though that MemoBot, when you install it, it does leak all of your computer information to China. I did read that. Allegedly. I did read that. How OpenClaw knows how to use desktop applications without API. It controls your monitor. It controls your desktop. It can see it and control it. That's the magic. You would be a great speaker politician. Well, I am a speaker. I'm speaking right now. You'd be a great live stream commenter. You'd be great at commenting in live streams, Hassan-D3007. As for politics, I'd do politics if The moment you became a politician, everyone didn't hate you. You know what I'm saying? If I became a politician, my YouTube channel is just dead because everyone would hate me. You know what I'm saying, big dog? If I could become a politician and spread my ideals, which I think are righteous ideals, and no one hated me, I would do it. First of all, you become a politician, you have to be a Democrat or a Republican. You can't be independent. If you're independent, you lose no matter what. So you have to choose one. If you decide to become a Democrat, all of Twitter hates you and you get canceled. If you decide to become a Republican, everyone else in the world hates you. There's no in-between. You're just dead in the water. I can't have a successful AI YouTube channel if I turn into a politician. Claude Bot for LA Mayor says, "Wasim Toukaid." That's not a bad idea. That's not a bad idea. If I have Henry become the politician, if I send Henry off to run for president and I just program it with all my own ideals, and everyone hates Henry and not me and I can keep doing my YouTube channel, and Henry runs for office, and I just make an Agent.md file with all my beliefs, that's not a bad idea. You would become corrupt once you enter politics. Oh, hell yeah, I'd become corrupt. Hell yeah. I mean, I'd still go for all my ideals, but if someone comes, "Hey, here's the $10 million check if you vote for illegalizing apples." I'm going, "Hell yeah, screw apples. Don't eat apples. Eating apples gives you autism. Hell yeah, you give me $10 million?" I'm saying apples gives you autism. Hell yeah. $10 million? That's my price. There's different levels of corruption. If you say, "Hey, tell everyone apples are bad for you," $10 million. If you go and say, "Hey, tell everyone AI is bad for the earth," I mean, that's probably $400 million. For $400 million, I'll go around saying AI is bad for the earth. You know what I'm saying? Sell out? It's not selling out. You're a sell out. I'm going to sell out. You're a sell out. Frons? Frons Boyer? Frons, you're telling me right now someone goes to you says, "Here's $400 million." You have to go around telling everyone apples are bad for you. You won't say that? Everyone's got a price. I'm just mad enough to say it. Frons. Bro, so unfocused. Okay, you tell me what to say, Xavier Hill. What do you want me to say? You know, no fun league. Is this a no fun stream? We can't have fun on the stream. When does your next video come out? In literally 12 minutes. Jesus doesn't have a price. That's a good point. What tutorial do you recommend for getting everything set up on a Mac for the first time as a beginner? My original video that has half a million views right now. My original video. It shows you how to set up on a Mac because I set it up on my own Mac. Go to my videos. Here you go. Boom. This one. Claude bought some of the most powerful AI tool ever. Might be the best video I've ever posted ever right there. Half a million views. Next video comes out in 11 minutes. It's going to be titled something like, "Stream froze." Shut up. No, it didn't. It's going to be titled something like, "You need a Mac Mini." for ClaudeBot. It's going to go through every way you can set up ClaudeBot on your computer. Mac Mini, VPS, online server, one click deploy, Mac Studio, old dusty HP laptop in your closet. It's going to go through each one of those and talk about what the strengths and the weaknesses of each. I searched for keywords and ClaudeBot Mac Mini is the second most searched keyword. I think a lot of people are searching for if you need a Mac Mini or not. I'm going to go through that. Just buy an old Mac. I mean, buy any of them. I recommend the Mac Mini, but you can buy any of them. That's coming out in 10 minutes. If you want to support your boy in 10 minutes, when I drop that video, turn on notifications now and you get the note that I put it out. Then you go, you open it up, you hit like on it and you watch it to the end. Best way to support. Are you avoiding the MemoBot questions? Well, I've already said 100 times, "I don't know what that is, so stop asking me about it." I've already said 100 times, "It's literally made by Chinese spies to extract all the information off your computer and send it to China, allegedly." I answer this question directly in my video that drops in nine minutes. In my video that drops in nine minutes, I answer that question directly. You will see all the pros and cons of AWS EC2 and why I do not recommend it. Have you tried Kimi K2 yet? Is it smart enough to be the brain? I've tried Kimi K2. It is a good model. I have not tested it as the brain for ClaudeBot yet. How do I run ClaudeBot on a Claude Pro plan? You go on your computer, you type in OpenClaw onboarding, you hit enter, it takes you through onboarding. When you get to the model section, you choose Claude OAuth. You hit enter and it takes you through how to set that up. What model brain do you recommend? Right now I recommend Opus 4.5 for the model and the brain. I think that is the best one. If you want cheaper, I'd recommend you watching this video right here, my latest one from two days ago. How to run ClaudeBot for dirt cheap. It will tell you what models to run as the brain for dirt cheap. Does your school have a decent guide to get set up on VPS and get it running as Henry does? Yes and no. No, it does not have a direct VPS tutorial. The good news is if you click on this video right here, ClaudeBot cheap and easy, it literally will walk you through setup of VPS. But to answer your second one, which is getting it up and running like Henry does, the answer to that is yes, I have tutorials on that in the Vibe Coding Academy. The boot camp from last week covers how I got it set up like Henry. So if you join, you'll get instant access to the last boot camp, which will tell you how to do that. What was the prompt to make bot do work overnight? It's what I said earlier, which was you brain dump everything about yourself. And then you set expectations like, hey, I want you to do work for me every night when I wake up and I get surprised by what you did. You just surprise me, build stuff that gets us closer to our goals, see what's trending online and build products that get us close to our goals. That's how you get it to be proactive. How old is too old for a Mac mini? Okay, Epstein. What would be the best model to scrap Twitter? What? How much do I earn from YouTube? $35,000. There you go. There's my revenue. $11,000 in the last month. That's how much I earn from YouTube. YouTube is a good platform. I think everyone should be building on YouTube. I go through YouTube tips too in the Vibe Coding Academy. It was a joke. It was a joke. Because you asked how old was too old for a Mac mini. You get the joke. Sometimes I can't make jokes because people don't get it and they get offended. That's been the number one bane in my existence. I can't make the dirty jokes because sometimes I make the dirty jokes and people don't get it and then they get offended. New video dropping in like 60 seconds. I'm going to move it up. New video. Oh, the folder studio, five euro. I want to lower my Claude API spend rather than sending full context each time. I'll do local embedding, semantic search first and send only the top chunks. Does that make sense to you? They just implemented in the latest update yesterday, QMD. It has local embeddings built in. Make sure to update to the latest version of OpenClaw. This is an OpenClaw channel. We turned into an OpenClaw channel. I think it's great. I do like the new Codex. I like the new Codex desktop app. I've been using it a bunch. It's very nice. I like the Codex model. OpenAI has been doing a great job of Codex. Great, great job of Codex. Adderall, Adderall, Adderall. I told you I've only done Adderall once in my life in college. I'm 35 years old, so I did Adderall 15 years ago. I didn't like it. Kept me up for three days. I didn't eat for three days, eat or sleep for three days. YouTube video. Top 10 Claude bot skills. That's a good video idea. I'm going to do that. Top 10 Claude bot skills to install immediately. That's a good idea. I'll record that. Duplicate. Top 10 Claude bot skills. Boom, that's a good one. Stream keeps freezing. I don't know, man. Freezing when you go open or go to the browser. Oh, every time I go to a new browser, it freezes. Is that what's happening? Money and climbing. Well, because you asked how old is too old, so I thought that was a funny reference. Make sure to subscribe down below if you haven't yet. This was an amazing stream. We hit 780, a new record.
